## John W. Tukey's High School and College Days

##  约翰·W·图基的高中和大学生活


Q: I am going to start with a somewhat personal question. We heard yesterday that you did not have a formal education, but were educated at home. Could you tell us a little bit about that?

Q： 我将从一个有点私人的问题开始。我们昨天听说你没有受过正规教育，但在家接受教育。你能告诉我们一点吗？


A: Okay, well, by the time I was five, my parents had settled in New Bedford. My father was head of the Latin Department in the High School. In those unregenerate days a married woman couldn't be a teacher in Massachussetts. So, my mother wasn't a teacher, but she was a substitute. And I have heard it claimed, that between the two of them, they ended up teaching everything in this high school, except bookkeeping and physical education. I think you have to add chemistry to that. And rumour says that my mother decided that it would be bad for me to go to school because, either I would get very lazy, or I'd be a problem, or something. And so, there wasn't too much formal education. But I spent a lot of time in the public library. New Bedford had a wonderful public library in those days. Not only did it have the Journal of the American Chemical Society, but it had the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. And I think the reason that I went to Brown as a chemist was because I could read the JACS, but I couldn't read the Transactions.

A： 好吧，到我五岁的时候，我父母已经在新贝德福德定居了。我父亲是高中拉丁系主任。在那些不可再生的日子里，一个已婚妇女不能在马萨楚塞特当老师。所以，我妈妈不是老师，但她是一名替补。我听说他们两人最终在这所高中教了所有的东西，除了记账和体育课。我认为你必须加入化学成分。传言说，我妈妈决定上学对我不好，因为，要么我会变得很懒，要么我是个问题，或者别的什么。因此，没有太多的正规教育。但我花了很多时间在公共图书馆。当时，新贝德福德有一个很棒的公共图书馆。它不仅有《美国化学学会杂志》，还有《美国数学学会汇刊》。我想我去布朗大学当化学家的原因是因为我能读JACS，但不能读Transactions。


Q: When you went to college did you regret being brought up in this isolated environment?

Q： 当你上大学时，你后悔在这种与世隔绝的环境中长大吗？


A: It wasn't that isolated; in the sense that I am not sure that the environment was more isolated than if I had gone to the high school. I actually went to the high school for one term in French and some mechanical drawing. I am not sure, if I am the last person to enter Brown with credit for mechanical drawing or not.

A： 这并不是孤立的；在某种意义上，我不确定环境是否比我上高中时更为孤立。我在高中上了一个学期的法语和一些机械制图。我不确定，我是不是最后一个进入布朗大学并获得机械制图学分的人。


Q: How did you enter Brown?

Q： 你是怎么进入布朗大学的？


A: College board exams. And so I went in and ended up with advanced credits in Mathematics and, I guess, German. So, I went to junior differen- tial equations as my freshman math course. We had a cousin who was the head of the mathematics department in the high school. But, again there wasn't too much formality. But I worked lots of problems in a calculus book, and that seemed to produce the necessary effects.

A： 大学董事会考试。所以我进去了，最终获得了数学和德语的高级学分。所以，我上了初级微分方程作为我的新生数学课程。我们有一个堂弟，他是高中数学系的主任。但是，这里也没有太多的礼节。但我在一本微积分书中解决了很多问题，这似乎产生了必要的效果。


Q: You did your Ph.D. at Princeton in mathematics. Tell us about that.

Q： 你在普林斯顿大学攻读数学博士学位。告诉我们。


A: I came to Princeton in '37 as a graduate student in chemistry, and ended up being a lab assistant in one of the freshman inorganic courses. In Princeton you had to be a Ph.D. to be a lab assistant in physical chemistry, which worried me a little because I had been a lab assistant in physical chemistry for a year and a half at Brown. But anyway, I fell over the fence the summer before I came to Princeton. I came in chemistry, but I spent a lot more time in old Fine Hall than in Frick; and I took prelims at the end of that year.

A： 我于37年来到普林斯顿大学，是一名化学研究生，最后成为了一门新生无机课程的实验室助理。在普林斯顿，你必须获得物理化学实验室助理的博士学位，这让我有点担心，因为我在布朗大学做了一年半的物理化学实验室助手。但无论如何，在我来到普林斯顿之前的那个夏天，我摔了一跤。我是学化学的，但我在老美术馆待的时间比在弗里克待的时间长得多；那年年底我参加了预赛。


Q: Harking back to Brown once more. Do you remember a particular Professor or course you liked?

Q： 再次回到布朗身上。你还记得你喜欢的某个教授或课程吗？

A: I don't think there was one that was an obvious dominant influence or anything of that sort. I knew most of the professors in the mathematics department and most of the professors in the chemistry department. I was there four years and, at one point, I was going to take a master's degree and an Sc.B. at the end of the four years. The department didn't like giving two degrees at the same time and so they decided to give me an Sc.B. after three years. But, W.A. Noyes, Jr. who was later the editor at JACS, used to claim that he did the glass blowing for my thesis experiments in my fourth year. I was well enough tuned in on the scuttlebutt in the math department. There was a lady graduate student who went to Illinois and the word came back that she was going to marry Pierce Ketchum who was a professor there. And so, I know who it was who proposed (in the math department) to send a telegram reading 'Congratulations, you Ketchum'. So, I didn't feel isolated! But, probably among the mathematicians, it was Tamarkin from whom I took a graduate course in the second, or third year; he was sort of the senior research man in Math at that point. Among the chemists - - the course work - - I don't think I have anything to say. I spent time with the physicists (and geologists) too. Bruce Lindsay, who was then chairman of the physics department, had come from New Bedford originally. I don't think I have a better answer for you.

A： 我不认为有一个是明显的主导影响或任何类似的东西。我认识数学系的大多数教授和化学系的大部分教授。我在那里待了四年，有一次，我打算在四年结束时获得硕士学位和理科学士学位。系里不喜欢同时授予两个学位，所以三年后他们决定给我一个理科学士学位。但是，后来担任JACS编辑的小W·A·诺伊斯（W.A.Noyes，Jr.）曾声称，他在我四年级时为我的论文实验做了玻璃吹制。我对数学系的翘楚很有兴趣。有一位女研究生去了伊利诺伊州，消息传来，她要嫁给那里的教授皮尔斯·凯彻姆。所以，我知道是谁提议（在数学系）发一封电报，上面写着“恭喜你，凯彻姆”。所以，我没有感到孤立！但是，可能是数学家中的塔玛金，我在第二年或第三年从他那里学习了研究生课程；在那个时候，他是数学领域的高级研究人员。在化学家中--课程工作--我想我没有什么好说的。我也和物理学家（和地质学家）在一起。时任物理系主任的布鲁斯·林赛（Bruce Lindsay）最初来自新贝德福德。我想我没有更好的答案了。


Q: When you went to Princeton as a graduate student, did you take courses, or did you immediately start on your research?

Q： 当你以研究生的身份去普林斯顿时，你是参加了课程，还是立即开始了研究？


A: No, no! I went to lots of courses and seminars in Fine and to the chemistry courses that a graduate student (first year) might reasonably be supposed to go to. Now, if I hadn't already fallen over the fence, I don't know. Henry Eyring was here in those days. Henry was a theoretical chemist who was the salt of the salt of the earth. And if I hadn't been so far over the fence - - and if Henry hadn't been away for a semester - - I might have stayed in chemistry a little longer. But in those days the Institute for Advanced Study and the math department were all mixed together in old Fine and people sort of didn't segregate, either in lectures, or in turning up for tea. Along in the spring of that first year when I was still a chemist, Marston Morse asked me whether I was at the University or at the Institute. Since I was still a chemist, I thought that was interesting. But what had been going on is that Norman Steenrod and I had been sitting in the two back corner seats in old Fine 113 and doing our best to keep Marston honest in the seminar he was giving.

A： 不，不！我参加了很多美术课程和研讨会，也参加了研究生（一年级）应该参加的化学课程。现在，如果我没有从围栏上摔下来，我不知道。亨利·埃林当年就在这里。亨利是一位理论化学家，他是地球之盐中的盐。如果我没有越过篱笆那么远——如果亨利没有离开一个学期——我可能会在化学方面待得更久。但在那些日子里，高等研究院和数学系都混在一起，在旧的Fine里，人们无论是在课堂上，还是在来喝茶时，都没有隔离。在我还是化学家的第一年春天，马斯顿·莫尔斯问我是在大学还是在研究所。因为我还是一名化学家，我觉得这很有趣。但发生的事情是，诺曼·斯蒂恩罗德和我一直坐在老Fine 113的两个后排角落的座位上，并尽最大努力让马斯顿在他举办的研讨会上保持诚实。


Q: In general topology I learned about Tukey's lemma and I know that you have made other important contributions to mathematics. I was wondering, how your transition from Mathematics into Statistics happened?

Q： 在一般拓扑学中，我了解了Tukey引理，我知道你对数学还有其他重要贡献。我想知道，你是如何从数学过渡到统计学的？


A: Practice! May '41 I went to work for Merrill Flood in Fire Control Research - - boom-boom fire control, not hose fire control. Charlie Winsor was there, and except for the year and a half that Charlie wasted in Washington in the Mine Warfare Research group, Charlie and I spent the war pretty much either in the same office or across the hall. Charlie knew an awful lot of statistics that wasn't in the books then, and I am sure a certain amount that isn't in the books yet. So I learned by talking to Charlie and by doing things and by reading.

A： 练习！41年5月，我去美林洪水消防研究所工作——繁荣繁荣的消防，而不是软管消防。查理·温斯（Charlie Winsor）在那里，除了查理在华盛顿的地雷战研究小组浪费了一年半的时间外，查理和我几乎都是在同一间办公室或在大厅对面度过战争。查理知道很多当时没有出现在书中的统计数据，我确信有一定数量的数据还没有出现在书里。所以我通过与查理交谈、做事和阅读来学习。


Q: Going back to your days as a graduate student in mathematics. Who were the professors among the mathematicians at Princeton whom you remember most?


Q： 回到你数学研究生时代。你最记得的普林斯顿大学数学家中的教授是谁？


A: Again I am not sure that one can pick individuals. I quote you a verse from the faculty song. Here's to Lefschetz, Solomon, L. unpredictable as hell, when, laid at last beneath the sod, then he'll begin to heckle God. That was what the Fine Hall verse that senior graduate students, probably years before, produced. That was a private verse for the faculty song. So, Lefschetz is one, Bohnenblust is another because he was a clear lecturer, Steenrod was on the faculty at that point, but we interacted lively, Tucker. Although there were a lot more contacts in Tucker's case during the war than before. I don't know just what to say.

A： 再次，我不确定是否可以挑选个人。我引用了教师歌曲中的一段歌词。这是给莱夫谢茨，所罗门，L。不可预知的地狱，当他最后躺在草皮下时，他会开始质问上帝。这就是可能是几年前，高级研究生创作的Fine Hall诗歌。那是教职工歌曲的私人诗句。所以，莱夫谢茨是其中之一，博恩布拉斯特是另一个，因为他是一个明确的讲师，斯蒂恩罗德当时是教员，但我们互动很活跃，塔克。虽然在战争期间塔克的案件中有比以前多得多的接触。我不知道该说什么。


Q: What about life in the graduate college? Do you remember any particular incidents?

Q： 研究生院的生活怎么样？你还记得什么特别的事件吗？


A: The situation in the graduate college was that fairly soon I joined a group of people who ate together. It was a continuation of a group that had eaten together the year before. This was before Hitler's invasions so it is perhaps not surprising that it was known as the Fuhrocracy and Lyman Spitzer, who just recently retired from across the street here, in Astrophysics, was officially the Fuehrer. He sat at the end of the table and if spare ice-creams needed to be divided it was his responsibility to divide them fairly. But there was a physicist or two, a couple of astrophysicists, one theoretical chemist, several mathematicians, and one romance-linguist, who was a courtesy member of the group, but who had been authorized to put anybody into a Klein bottle that he wanted to. But, Ralph Boas, who was a national research postdoc, and Frank Smithies who was over for a year from Cambridge, and I ended up hanging out together a fair amount. So, we were just three people who sat through Aurel Wintner's lectures on convolutions and so when the Princeton notes came out we were the note writers, the only other person was Cyrus McDuffe - and so, the Library of Congress card to this reads, notes by Ralph Boas, Frank Smithies, John Tukey with sympathetic encouragement from Cyrus C. McDuffie. And when the seminar came to the end at the end of spring, McDuffie packed us all into his car and the whole group went up to North Jersey for the day. Again, there was no shortage of interaction.

A： 研究生院的情况是，很快我就加入了一群一起吃饭的人。这是前一年一起吃饭的一群人的延续。这是希特勒入侵之前的事，因此，它被称为“富国主义”也许并不奇怪，莱曼·斯皮策（Lyman Spitzer）最近刚刚从这里的街道对面退休，在天体物理学方面，他正式成为了元首。他坐在桌子的最后，如果需要分配多余的冰淇淋，他有责任公平地分配。但有一两位物理学家、几位天体物理学家、一位理论化学家、几位数学家和一位浪漫主义语言学家，他们是该小组的礼貌成员，但他们被授权将任何人放入他想要的克莱因瓶中。但是，拉尔夫·博阿斯（Ralph Boas）是一名国家研究博士后，弗兰克·史密斯（Frank Smithies）从剑桥大学毕业一年，我和他一起出去玩了很多。所以，我们只有三个人坐在奥雷尔·温特纳（Aurel Wintner）关于卷积的讲座上，所以当普林斯顿笔记出版时，我们是笔记作者，唯一的另一个人是赛鲁斯·麦克杜夫（Cyrus McDuffe），所以，国会图书馆的卡片上写着：拉尔夫·博阿斯（Ralph Boas）、弗兰克·史密斯（Frank Smithies）的笔记，约翰·图基（John Tukey）受到赛勒斯·C·麦克杜菲（Cyrus C.McDuffie）的同情鼓励。当研讨会在春季末结束时，麦克杜菲把我们都塞进了他的车里，整个小组都去了新泽西州。同样，互动并不缺乏。


I am not sure which year it was, it must have been the next year. Arthur Stone bought some paper for his ring notebook at Woolworth's and since he had a British notebook, he had to cut an inch off it. Since he had all these strips of paper, he had to do something interesting with them. So, he was folding the regular polygons and he was smart enough to recognize the first known hexaflexagon when it was made. So that Arthur and Brian Tuckerman and Dick Feynman and I spent a fair amount of time on flexagon theory. The asymptotic formula is known for the number of different hexaflexagons with $\mathrm{n}$ sides, for example. It turns out to be equivalent to the problem of triangulating a regular polygon. etc.

我不确定是哪一年，肯定是第二年。亚瑟·斯通（Arthur Stone）在伍尔沃斯（Woolworth's）买了一些纸做他的环形笔记本，因为他有一个英国笔记本，所以他不得不把它剪掉一英寸。因为他有所有这些纸条，所以他不得不用它们做一些有趣的事情。所以，他在折叠正多边形，他很聪明，在制作时就认出了第一个已知的六角龙。因此，亚瑟、布莱恩·塔克曼、迪克·费曼和我花了相当多的时间来研究弹性理论。例如，对于具有$\mathrm｛n｝$边的不同六边形的数量，渐近公式是已知的。事实证明，这相当于三角化正多边形的问题。等


Q: Who was your advisor?

Q： 谁是你的顾问？


A: I think Lefschetz. You know, Peisakoff played the version in the opposite direction. I think I was supposed to be his advisor, but I was not at all convinced.

A： 我想是莱夫谢茨。你知道，佩萨科夫的版本是相反的。我想我应该是他的顾问，但我一点也不相信。


Q: I was going to ask you whether you advised any math Ph.D. students after starting to work as an instructor.

Q： 我想问你，在开始担任讲师后，你是否为数学博士生提供过建议。


A: Not that I can specifically think of. But I was really only two years there. In May 1941 I pulled out across Nassau street. 

A： 不是我能具体想到的。但我真的只有两年。1941年5月，我在拿骚街对面停车。


## The War Years

##  战争年代


Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the work in the fire control group during the war.

Q： 你能告诉我们一些战时消防小组的工作吗。


A: It started out as a project to study the training of height and range finder operators. Do you know what a stereoscopic range finder is? It is a situation where you see the field differently in the two eyes and there's a reference mark and you can try to make the reference mark appear at the same distance as the target. Details are not that important for the present purposes. And it was mainly stereoscopic height finders, i.e. they had automatic conversion of range to height for antiaircraft fire and then all the big naval guns used stereoscopic range finders, because most of the fire against naval targets was against targets that you could see at least the mast of. Particularly if you put the range finder high in the other ship's mast. And Brock McMillan, who was I guess a year or so ahead of me as a postdoc, ended up with other people at Fortress Monroe running a field laboratory and the group in Princeton was a combination of true target position and analysis. The point is, if you're going to test height finders and height finder observers, you have to have some way to know how high the target really is. And so there were recording phototheodolites which somebody tried to keep pointing at the target. Where the image showed in the frame you could correct and get a good idea of what the angle of the target was. Then we had one of the first IBM multiplying punches and so we actually got IBM calculations of what the true heights actually were. But, there was a lot of physiology and fairly soon there was more to do with the hardware. Why there were temperature errors? We pioneered filling the height finder with helium instead of air, the point being the thermal conductivity of helium is about seven times that of air. So the temperature gradients inside the instrument were much smaller if you filled it with helium. And this broadened to get into armoured vehicle fire control. We had various interactions with Frankford Arsenal and eventually we were, for a while, funded out of there. We had some civil service personnel here at 20 Nassau and they couldn't be told what to do by anybody but a government employee. So, a couple of us became parttime technical experts so we could supervise the civil service people. Then Colonel Trichel moved to Washington and we ended up getting involved in testing rocket powder (because he took over the corresponding section of the Office, Chief of Ordnance and then later on we came back to NDRC because there was this project (AC-92) which was trying to do all the fixes on the B29 as an operational device that they could. And, we ended up being the coordinating group and, as I say, that's when I learned to ride airplanes. The Mt. Wilson observatory people were hanging up little models of aircrafts with light shining out of them to see what the defensive fire coverage really was for different formations, and there were people in two or three places in Texas, and also something was going on at Smoky Hill Army Air Field in Kansas. Those who've never seen a loaded B29 take off in Kansas probably missed a sight that will never recur again. This was the really flat Kansas and loaded B29s would go down the runway - - I think they had somewhere between a 10000 foot and 12000 foot runway - - and then they disappeared under the curve of the earth and you wouldn't see them till they were maybe 10 or 20 miles out. With that engine, by the time you got up to somewhere between 100 feet and 200 feet, the temperature on the engine was over red line and you had to flatten out (to ease the load on the engines and let them cool a little) before you could fly up the rest of the way. This is why the airstrips on Tinian and Saipan, and so on, always went to the water's edge to get maximum clearance, except for wave heights. After that job wound up I went to work for Murray Hill (Bell Labs) and was involved in the first paper-and-pencil study for what was called AAGM1 and later called NIKE and later called NIKE-AJAX after it started having big brothers. This was an anti-aircraft guided missile. Bernie Holbrook (who was, we finally decided later, something like a ninth-and-a-half cousin of mine), a switching engineer, and I, we did trajectory, aerodynamics and war head for the paper-and-pencil study, both of us being "experts" in all these fields. But on the other hand the state of supersonic aerodynamics was poor even if we got all of the best information. We went to Langley and talked to the people around the wind tunnels and so on. Then, when Don Ling came to work for the Labs somewhat later, he produced a little pink paper - - meaning unofficial draft memo - - ascribing to me the theorem that if a semi-continuous function had its values known at three points it was well-determined, but if it was a continuous function you only had to know its value at one point. That was about the state of knowledge of supersonic aerodynamics. People were still taking seriously the linearized theory that in particular said that the control surfaces would start to work oppositely when you went through Mach equals root three. Of course, nothing of that sort ever happened. So, I stayed with this. Afterwards I spent a fair amount of my Murray Hill time in connection with NIKE for quite a long time. I got to go on impact parties out at the White Sands Proving Grounds, which meant going around through the boondocks and seeing if you can find the pieces that came down. 

A： 它最初是一个研究高度和测距仪操作员培训的项目。你知道什么是立体测距仪吗？在这种情况下，你用两只眼睛看到的视野不同，有一个参考标记，你可以尝试使参考标记与目标的距离相同。就目前而言，细节并不那么重要。它主要是立体式测距仪，也就是说，它们可以自动将距离转换为高度，用于防空射击，然后所有大型舰炮都使用立体式测距机，因为大多数针对海军目标的射击都是针对至少可以看到桅杆的目标。特别是如果你把测距仪放在另一艘船的桅杆上。布罗克·麦克米兰（Brock McMillan），我想他比我早一年左右做博士后，最后和门罗要塞的其他人一起经营了一个野外实验室，普林斯顿大学的团队是真正的目标定位和分析的结合。重点是，如果你要测试高度探测器和高度探测器观察者，你必须有某种方法知道目标到底有多高。因此，有人试图一直指向目标的记录光电经纬仪。图像显示在帧中的位置，您可以纠正并很好地了解目标的角度。然后我们有了第一个IBM乘法拳，所以我们实际上得到了真正高度的IBM计算结果。但是，有很多生理学方面的问题，很快硬件方面就有了更多的问题。为什么会出现温度误差？我们首创了用氦气代替空气来填充测高仪，重点是氦气的热导率大约是空气的七倍。所以如果你用氦气填充，仪器内部的温度梯度会小得多。这一领域扩大到装甲车火力控制领域。我们与弗兰克福德阿森纳进行了各种互动，最终我们得到了一段时间的资金支持。我们在拿骚20号有一些公务员，除了政府雇员，任何人都不能告诉他们该做什么。因此，我们中的一些人成为了兼职技术专家，以便我们能够监督公务员。然后，特里谢上校搬到了华盛顿，我们最终参与了火箭火药的测试（因为他接管了办公室的相应部门，军械长，后来我们又回到了发改委，因为有一个项目（AC-92）正在尝试对B29进行所有修复，作为他们可以操作的设备。而且，我们最终成为了协调小组，正如我所说，那是我学会驾驶飞机的时候。威尔逊山天文台的人们挂起了一些飞机模型，灯光从中发出，以了解不同编队的防御火力覆盖范围，德克萨斯州有两三个地方有人，堪萨斯州斯莫基山陆军航空场也发生了一些事情。那些从未见过满载的B29在堪萨斯州起飞的人可能会错过一次再也不会出现的景象。这是一个非常平坦的堪萨斯州，满载的B29将沿着跑道降落——我想他们的跑道在10000英尺到12000英尺之间——然后他们消失在地球的曲线下，直到他们离开10或20英里，你才能看到他们。有了这台发动机，当你到达100英尺到200英尺之间的某个地方时，发动机上的温度已经超过了红线，你必须在剩下的飞行过程中保持平稳（以减轻发动机的负荷并让它们稍微冷却）。这就是为什么天宁岛和塞班岛等地的简易机场总是靠近水边，以获得最大的净空，除了浪高。在那份工作结束后，我去了Murray Hill（贝尔实验室）工作，并参与了AAGM1的第一次纸笔研究，后来被称为NIKE，后来又被称为NIKE-AJAX，因为它开始有了大兄弟。这是一枚防空导弹。伯尼·霍尔布鲁克（Bernie Holbrook，后来我们终于决定，他有点像我九岁半的表亲），一名开关工程师，我和我，我们为纸笔研究做了弹道、空气动力学和战争头脑，我们都是所有这些领域的“专家”。但另一方面，即使我们得到了所有最好的信息，超音速空气动力学的状态也很差。我们去了兰利，和风洞周围的人交谈，等等。后来，当Don Ling稍晚来到实验室工作时，他写了一篇粉红色的小论文——意思是非正式的备忘录草稿——给我一个定理：如果一个半连续函数的值在三个点上是已知的，那么它是很好确定的，但如果它是一个连续函数，你只需要知道它在一个点上的值。这是关于超音速空气动力学知识的状态。人们仍然认真对待线性化理论，特别是当你通过马赫数等于根3时，控制面将开始反向工作。当然，这类事情从未发生过。所以，我坚持了下来。之后，我花了相当长一段时间与NIKE建立联系。我得去白沙试验场参加冲击派对，这意味着要穿过偏僻的地方，看看你能不能找到掉下来的碎片。


## Statistics in the Forties and Fifties

##  四五十年代的统计


Q: Coming back to your statistics education. You were turned into a statistician through practice.

Q： 回到你的统计教育。你通过实践变成了统计学家。


A: And eating an average of $1.9$ meals a day with Charlie Winsor over probably the equivalent of three years.

A： 与查理·温斯（Charlie Winsor）在三年的时间里平均每天吃1.9美元的饭。


Q: So, he was a major influence on you?

Q： 所以，他对你有重大影响？


A: Yes.

A： 是的。


Q: Did you ever read a statistics book?

Q： 你读过统计书吗？


A: Oh, yes. When I was at Brown I read a lot of miscellaneous books in the math library, including some statistics books. Even back at that stage. I used to have a little tin container with 3 by 5 cards in it that had interesting looking tables of critical values for statistics. That didn't mean I had any feel for them. But on the other hand I am one of the - - I suspect not inconsiderable number - - who taught a graduate course in statistics before he ever sat in a course of statistics.

A： 哦，是的。当我在布朗大学时，我在数学图书馆读了很多杂书，包括一些统计书。甚至在那个阶段。我曾经有一个小锡容器，里面有3乘5张卡片，上面有一些有趣的统计临界值表。这并不意味着我对他们有任何感觉。但另一方面，我是其中一个——我怀疑这不是一个微不足道的数字——在他参加统计课程之前，他曾教过统计学研究生课程。


Q: You took no course from Sam Wilks?

Q： 你没学过萨姆·威尔克斯的课？


A: No course of this sort, no. But I saw the books and looked through them. Sam and I did a little joint work.

A： 没有这类课程，没有。但我看到了这些书，并翻阅了它们。山姆和我一起做了一点工作。


Q: Around 1945 through 1950 could you describe the statistical community in the US.

Q： 从1945年到1950年，你能描述一下美国的统计界吗。


A: WeIl, I'Il just have to try to isolate that period by guess. ASA had been meeting yearly since lord only knows when, maybe since the foundation. The Institute I think came into existence in 1938. In those days to join the Institute you had to be proposed by two members. They were worried about keeping the nonmathematical statisticians out for a while. That they gradually recovered from. The Biometrics section of ASA had been in existence and ENAR came into existence probably in late ' 45 . This is the Eastern North American Region of the Biometric Society. I think it would have been late 45 and not 46 , one day there was a meeting in Woods Hole to set up the Biometric Society followed by the first meeting of ISI after the war in Washington. And Linder and Fisher and I and someone else shared a sort of a four room suite at the hotel at this (Washington) meeting. But, it was somewhere about this time there some discussion about the vigor of comments in biometrics meetings. We had one of the very good biologists give a talk. And people had asked questions as vigorously as usual. So, there was some question at lunch whether the speakers had been unfairly treated. The outcome of this was that it was agreed that at a biometric meeting one was entitled to ask any question that one felt like. So, the biometric thing was an area of activity. I think more so than mathematical statistics. But mathematical statistics more so than ASA in general. Who were the key figures? After Sam Wilks, Hotelling and Wald, really I think you have to count Gertrude Cox and George Snedecor. Although Cox and Snedecor were not research contributing types, they still played a large role. From an older generation A.T. Craig in Iowa City and on the coast of course Neyman and the people that he'd drawn together. And fairly soon Bowker at Stanford because of his building-up powers. This isn't an exclusive list. Now, if you took a biometric flavour, you would get a different set of people. You probably have to get Cochran in both sets. People who'd be respected on the biometric side certainly would include our friend at the Mayo Clinic, Joe Berkson, who was a red-headed Irishman. Red was pretty much faded in the hair but not in the spirit. Since he had both an MD and a Ph.D. you couldn't put him down in any obvious manner if you got into an argument. Now, maybe it's relevant that I think I made some comments at about that time that the person that I would be most careful with if they were in the audience and I was giving a paper was Milton Friedman. Because Milton had worked with Allan Wallis at a different Columbia research group during the war. This is the one that produced the sequential analysis things. One day they took Jack Wolfowitz out to lunch and worked him over thoroughly about the importance of doing something with this. A month later when nothing came of that, they took Abraham Wald out to lunch and he came in the next morning with the fundamental identity of sequential analysis. Milton was well acquainted with the statistical side and very sharp. Probably easier to cut yourself on him than anybody else in the Biometric Society or the Institute. Of course Jimmy Savage was well started on his way up by that time. As of ' 46 if either Jimmy or Fred Mosteller was in a room out of sight talking, no one could tell which one it was. They'd spent so much time working together during the war that they ended up equivalent in accent.

A： 嗯，我只是想通过猜测来隔离那段时间。自从上帝只知道什么时候，也许从基金会开始，ASA每年都会开会。我认为该研究所成立于1938年。在那些日子里，你必须由两名成员提议才能加入研究所。他们担心让非数学统计学家暂时离开。他们逐渐从中恢复过来。ASA的生物计量部分已经存在，ENAR可能在45年后期出现。这是生物识别协会的北美东部地区。我想应该是45晚了，而不是46晚了。有一天，在伍兹霍尔召开了一次会议，成立了生物识别协会，随后ISI在华盛顿召开了战后的第一次会议。在这次（华盛顿）会议上，林德、费希尔和我以及其他人在酒店共享了一套四居室的套房。但是，大约在这个时候的某个时候，生物识别会议上有一些关于评论活力的讨论。我们请了一位非常好的生物学家做了一次演讲。人们像往常一样积极地提问。因此，在午餐时，有人质疑演讲者是否受到了不公平的待遇。这样做的结果是，双方同意，在生物识别会议上，一个人有权提出自己想问的任何问题。所以，生物特征是一个活跃的领域。我认为这比数理统计更重要。但一般来说，数理统计比ASA更重要。关键人物是谁？继萨姆·威尔克斯、霍特林和沃尔德之后，我真的认为你必须数格特鲁德·考克斯和乔治·斯内德。虽然考克斯和斯内德克不是研究贡献型，但他们仍然发挥了很大的作用。来自艾奥瓦市的老一代A.T.克雷格，当然还有内曼和他所吸引的人们。很快鲍克就在斯坦福大学学习了，因为他的能力越来越强。这不是独家列表。现在，如果你有生物特征的味道，你会得到一组不同的人。你可能必须在两盘比赛中都让科克伦上场。在生物特征方面受到尊重的人当然包括我们在梅奥诊所的朋友乔·伯克森，他是一个红头发的爱尔兰人。红色在头发上几乎褪色了，但在精神上却没有。既然他既有医学博士，又有哲学博士，如果你陷入争论，你不能以任何明显的方式贬低他。现在，也许我认为当时我发表了一些评论，如果他们在观众席上，我会非常小心地与米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）合作，这是相关的。因为米尔顿在战争期间曾与艾伦·沃利斯在哥伦比亚的另一个研究小组共事。这是一个产生顺序分析的东西。有一天，他们带着杰克·沃尔福威茨出去吃午饭，让他彻底了解了用这个做点什么的重要性。一个月后，当这一切都没有发生时，他们带着亚伯拉罕·沃尔德出去吃午饭，第二天早上，他带着序列分析的基本身份来到了这里。米尔顿非常熟悉统计方面，而且非常敏锐。也许比生物识别学会或研究所的任何人都更容易把自己的身体砍在他身上。当然，当时吉米·萨维奇在上升的道路上起步很好。截至46年，如果吉米或弗雷德·莫斯特勒在一个看不见的房间里讲话，没人能分辨出是哪一个。在战争期间，他们花了很多时间在一起工作，结果他们的口音相当。


## John Tukey's Work for the Federal Government

##  约翰·图基的联邦政府工作


Q: I would like to go on to your work with the government. You were a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee. Do you recall incidents from those meetings?

Q： 我想继续你在政府的工作。你是总统科学咨询委员会的成员。你还记得那些会议中的事件吗？


A: Jaa.. I'll give you an anecdote. But let me remark, I don't think that over those years I did any statistics (for PSAC). But one of the earlier environmental reports was being discussed and there were people in from some of the government agencies. And it became clear to them that PSAC was going to have, if anything, kind words to say for Rachel Carson in Silent Spring. And the people from agriculture practically wept in their beer. They didn't think that she should receive any mention or notice whatsoever. Q: The FFT got started at a meeting of PSAC?

A： 贾。。我给你讲个轶事。但我要说的是，我不认为这些年我做过任何统计（PSAC）。但一份早期的环境报告正在讨论中，一些政府机构的人也参与了讨论。他们很清楚，PSAC将在《寂静的春天》中为蕾切尔·卡森说些好话。来自农业的人们几乎在啤酒中哭泣。他们认为她不应该受到任何提及或通知。Q： FFT是在PSAC会议上开始的？


A: That's not quite the story. The FFT's realization was partly influenced by PSAC meetings. I used to sit next to Dick Garwin down at the far end of the table. This was in the room in old State which had once been the secretary's office. This was the room in which the Secretary of State saw the Japanese envoys just before Pearl Harbor. I was sitting there scratching and Dick wanted to know what and I told him what it was about generally. He went back to Watson Lab and he had some things going on that required some large Fourier transforms and so he tried to get Jim Cooley to program this. And after a while Jim did regard it solely as a programming exercise - - all the theory was done. I didn't think all the theory was done and this is why there is the Cooley-Tukey paper. It really didn't start there and the initial reference is probably the Princeton Notes on a graduate course in time series, which I think either matched or pre-dated this. And what really happened in due course is that Jim Cooley produced one algorithm and Gordon Sande produced the transposed algorithm. And eventually IBM kicked Jim into publication because they decided they didn't want to try to patent it and they didn't want anybody else to. And somebody fell out to be a co-author and I sort of floated along and didn't take adequate action to see that Gordon got his stuff out, which I always felt bad about. Q: Your work on the PAQAB seems at least have in part led to the award of the Presidential Medal of Science. Could you elaborate on the work you did there?

A： 这不完全是事实。FFT的实现部分受到PSAC会议的影响。我过去常坐在桌子最远端的迪克·加文旁边。这是在旧州的一个房间里，那里曾经是秘书的办公室。就在珍珠港之前，国务卿在这个房间里见到了日本特使。我坐在那里搔痒，迪克想知道什么，我告诉了他这是怎么回事。他回到沃森实验室，他做了一些事情，需要一些大的傅里叶变换，所以他试图让吉姆·库利来编程。过了一段时间，吉姆确实认为这只是一个编程练习——所有的理论都完成了。我不认为所有的理论都完成了，这就是为什么有库利·图基的论文。它真的不是从那里开始的，最初的参考文献可能是研究生课程的《普林斯顿笔记》（Princeton Notes），按时间序列排列，我认为它要么与此相匹配，要么早于此。在适当的时候真正发生的是，吉姆·库利产生了一个算法，戈登·桑德产生了转置算法。最终，IBM把吉姆踢进了出版物，因为他们决定不想申请专利，也不想让其他人申请。有人失约成为合作者，而我有点随波逐流，没有采取足够的行动来确保戈登把自己的东西拿出来，这让我一直觉得很糟糕。Q： 你在PAQAB上的工作似乎至少在一定程度上导致了总统科学奖章的颁发。你能详细说明你在那里做的工作吗？


A: I doubt if there was very much connection. That sounds to me like something that got mentioned in a list because it was handy. PAQAB (President's Air Quality Advisory Board) was moderately effective. This was in the first Ruckelshaus era as EPA administrator and Ruckelshaus was still optimistic, feeling that if you talked nicely and informatively to the polluters you could get them to stop polluting. He learned quite rapidly. It was a respectable advisory group but nothing in particular.

A： 我怀疑是否有很多联系。在我看来，这听起来像是列表中提到的东西，因为它很方便。PAQAB（总统空气质量咨询委员会）的效果一般。这是在第一个Ruckelshaus时代，作为环保局局长，Ruckelsaus仍然乐观，认为如果你与污染者友好、非正式地交谈，你就能让他们停止污染。他学得很快。这是一个值得尊敬的咨询小组，但没有什么特别之处。


Presumably, that got cited along with Restoring the Quality of our Environment, a report that was originally a great society task force for (President) Johnson. There were ten such, nine of them reported through one channel in the White House, we reported through another one. Nine of them leaked, one of them didn't. And after things were over, it was decided that this ought to be converted into a report for the general public and this was done under PSAC auspices. So that this is where the Restoring of the Quality of our Environment came from. That was the first all-types-of-pollution moderately-comprehensive report. We beat the Academy group under Athelston Spilhaus by about 6 months. So, PAQAB sounds interesting but is not worth particular attention, by comparison. 

据推测，这与《恢复我们的环境质量》一起被引用，该报告最初是约翰逊总统的一个伟大的社会工作组。有十个这样的，其中九个通过白宫的一个渠道报道，我们通过另一个渠道进行报道。其中九个泄露了，其中一个没有泄露。事情结束后，决定将其转换为面向公众的报告，并在PSAC的主持下完成。因此，这就是恢复环境质量的由来。这是第一份全面的各类污染报告。我们以大约6个月的时间击败了Athelston Spilhaus领导的Academy小组。因此，PAQAB听起来很有趣，但相比之下并不值得特别关注。


## Statistical Education: Theory, Consulting, EDA, etc.

##  统计教育：理论、咨询、EDA等。


Q: What are your views on education? How should we train the future generations of statisticians?

Q： 你对教育有什么看法？我们应该如何培养未来几代统计学家？


A: Now, let's just get the ground rules clear! Are we talking about education of statisticians, education in statistics, or education in general.

A： 现在，让我们把基本规则弄清楚！我们谈论的是统计学家教育、统计教育还是一般教育。


Q: Let's start with education of graduate students in statistics. How much math, how little math? Does it help, does it hurt?

Q： 让我们从统计学研究生的教育开始。多少数学，多少数学？有帮助吗，疼吗？


A: I think the answer to that one is: First, there shouldn't be a single answer. Secondly, it's not the whole story. Mathematics didn't hurt me, as I understand it, when one graduate student came to Princeton, the word among the grad students in the graduate college was - - here is someone who is never going to get a Ph.D. from Princeton in math. He met the formal requirements all right. But, if he had been pushed too hard in math, something would have had to break. And statistics couldn't have done without having him as a statistician. So the answer is there are places where it can hurt badly. You can't live these days with no math. But neither, I suspect, can the average graduate student live with all the math required to adequately cope with what's in the journals. They talk about practicing defensive medicine. Statisticians may have to practice defensive mathematics. I well remember a remark Charlie Winsor made walking down just in front of old Fine. Charlie said: "Sam Wilks trains good mathematical statisticians and it's surprising how soon they become good statisticians." Now, what I worry about most about the math is well, firstly, the loss of some people who can think well and who can do good things and, secondly, also the deflection of people away from thinking about what they can do much more effectively. I think everybody appreciated Paul Velleman's speech yesterday. Paul came to Princeton from essentially a mathematical sociology program and he managed to survive the necessary mathematics. But, I think it was survival rather than anything else. So, if, given a choice between turning out proto-statistician B with no mathematics and proto-statistician $F$ with no feeling for analysing data. I think I'd almost rather turn out proto-statistician B although I wouldn't feel it would be fair to him or her, because it would not leave them in the position of practising defensive mathematics after they came out. That would be protecting them and protecting their position among the purists in the field rather than what was needed to do the job. They would feel maybe they need some more mathematics. Now, this is an uncomfortable side of things - it is much easier to teach mathematics, that is to those who will be taught, than it is to teach some of the other things.

A： 我认为答案是：首先，不应该有一个答案。其次，这并不是全部。据我所知，数学并没有伤害到我，当一名研究生来到普林斯顿时，研究生院的研究生中有一个词是——这是一个永远无法从普林斯顿获得数学博士学位的人。他完全符合正式要求。但是，如果他在数学上被推得太厉害，就会有什么事情发生。如果没有他做统计学家，统计工作就无法完成。所以答案是，在某些地方，它会造成严重的伤害。没有数学你就活不了这些日子。但我怀疑，普通的研究生也不能接受足够应付期刊上的内容所需的所有数学知识。他们谈论练习防御性医学。统计学家可能必须练习防御性数学。我还记得查理·温索在老费恩面前说的一句话。查理说：“萨姆·威尔克斯培养了优秀的数学统计学家，他们很快就成为了优秀的统计学家，这令人惊讶。”现在，我对数学最担心的是，首先，失去了一些能够思考得很好、做得很好的人，其次，人们偏离了思考他们能做得更有效的事情。我想大家都很欣赏保罗·维尔曼昨天的演讲。保罗来到普林斯顿，基本上是从一个数学社会学课程毕业的，他成功地完成了必要的数学课程。但是，我认为这是生存而不是其他。所以，如果让我们在不懂数学的原始统计学家B和不懂分析数据的原始统计员$F$之间做出选择。我想我几乎宁愿成为原始统计学家B，尽管我觉得这对他或她不公平，因为这不会让他们在出来后就处于练习防御性数学的境地。这将保护他们，保护他们在该领域的纯粹主义者中的地位，而不是做这项工作所需要的。他们会觉得也许他们需要更多的数学知识。现在，这是令人不舒服的一面——教数学，也就是教那些将要被教的人，比教其他一些东西容易得多。


There are places where it can hurt badly. I may have caricatured my position a little, but not very much. 


有些地方会很疼。我可能有点夸张了我的立场，但不是很夸张。

Q: How about consulting? Should that be an important part in the training of Ph.D. statisticians?


Q： 咨询怎么样？这是否应该成为博士统计学家培训的重要组成部分？


A: If you can do it right. If you have a department where none of the professors have ever done any consulting, then it's - - to say the least - dangerous. You can do some of that by interaction. The old Applied Statistics seminar here that I ran for many years which pulled in people from outside to talk about their problems and who were told there were only two axioms for the seminar, (1) they need not know the answers to the problems they talked about and (2) the audience could ask almost any question any time. I think that had many of the virtues of a formal consulting situation as far as the graduate students were concerned.

A： 如果你能做对的话。如果你所在的系里没有一位教授做过任何咨询，那么——可以说是最不危险的。你可以通过互动来做到这一点。我在这里举办了多年的旧的应用统计学研讨会，吸引了来自外部的人来讨论他们的问题，他们被告知研讨会只有两个公理：（1）他们不需要知道他们所讨论的问题的答案；（2）观众可以随时问任何问题。我认为，就研究生而言，这具有正式咨询的许多优点。


You heard Karen yesterday say that what she was talking about and what she's worked on mainly since she got her degree, came out of a graduate student project. There were a number of graduate students who had a feeling they just didn't have any feel for data and so we got together and we decided to try to do something with some of the cancer atlas data. The better consultants you got on the faculty, the more importance you can afford to give to various sorts of consulting arrangements. Because you'll be able to teach the students not only the feel for data and thinking about data, but also about interacting with people in the consultant's role. And that's almost equally important.

你昨天听到凯伦说，她所说的，以及她获得学位以来主要从事的工作，都来自一个研究生项目。有很多研究生觉得他们对数据没有任何感觉，所以我们聚在一起，决定尝试使用一些癌症图谱数据。你在教员中得到的顾问越多，你就越能重视各种各样的咨询安排。因为你不仅能教学生对数据的感觉和对数据的思考，还能教学生如何与顾问角色的人互动。这几乎同样重要。


Q: What is your present view on EDA? How should it be taught, to whom should it be taught?

Q： 您目前对EDA的看法是什么？应该怎样教，应该教给谁？


A: Well, as some of you know - most of you don't $-$ - in principle, work is going forward for a second edition. And, the main thing that will happen is some of the more unnecessarily complicated things in EDA will go out and be replaced by simpler ones. There'll also be a few things that have come along since then and need to be added.

A： 嗯，正如你们中的一些人所知道的，原则上你们中的大多数人都不知道，第二版的工作正在进行中。而且，将要发生的主要事情是EDA中一些不必要的复杂事物将被淘汰，取而代之的是更简单的事物。从那时起，还有一些事情需要补充。


How should it be taught? I guess my only answer to that is "Whatever way a really interested teacher wants to teach it!"

应该如何教授？我想我唯一的答案是“无论一个真正感兴趣的老师想用什么方式教它！”


Who should it be taught to? In one extreme, David Hoaglin taught it in a graduate course at Harvard for a while. He was thinking of teaching it for a quarter and the students wanted more. Charlie Smith's mother tried some teaching in high school with it.

应该教给谁？在一个极端的情况下，大卫·霍格林在哈佛大学的研究生课程中教授了一段时间。他想教四分之一，学生们想要更多。查理·史密斯的母亲在高中时尝试过用它教学。


To whom it should be taught? I think, anybody who is willing to stand for it. There is a famous example that I can't report in complete detail because I've forgotten some of them - - of somebody at Chicago who really couldn't stand it and ended up by starting statistics courses in three different divisions of the university at three different levels from undergraduate to graduate and kept dropping them because they started to teach EDA. There are people like that - - not very many we hope - - it doesn't pay to teach it to them. But, if you're going to teach it to people who have a statistical background that's more difficult then teaching it to people without. But they are entitled to get more supplementary material and some indication of how things lock together or do not lock together.

应该教给谁？我想，任何愿意支持它的人。有一个著名的例子，我无法详细报道，因为我已经忘记了其中的一些例子——芝加哥的某个人真的受不了，最终在大学的三个不同部门，从本科到研究生，在三个不同的层次上开始了统计学课程，并因为他们开始而不断放弃教EDA。有这样的人——我们希望不是很多人——教给他们是不值得的。但是，如果你要把它教给有统计学背景的人，那就比教给没有统计学背景的人们更困难。但他们有权获得更多补充材料，以及一些关于事物如何锁定或不锁定的指示。


Q: In your case, a second important part of your education was chemistry.

Q： 就你而言，你教育的第二个重要部分是化学。


A: First! I have as many chemistry degrees as pure mathematics and none in Statistics.

A： 首先！我有和纯数学一样多的化学学位，但没有统计学学位。


Q: Do you think it is a good idea to have an undergraduate degree in statistics?

Q： 你认为拥有统计学学士学位是个好主意吗？


A: It seems to me the places who do this and take it seriously do fairly well. Have you ever seen the paper "The Education of a Scientific Generalist?" This represents an optimistic view of the kind of diverse education that it might pay to give some people who wanted to head for scientific generalist. Those who haven't heard of the paper should know that the four authors are Hendrik Bode who was at Bell Labs and was the man who had a lot to do with feedback technology, and Mosteller and Charlie Winsor. We didn't have any great difficulty agreeing on something to put down as a proposal. But I think the answer to this one depends on what you've got in the way of an academic organization to fit into. Doing this in a mathematics department, at any place, Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Brown, can only - I think - - be described as totally unfeasible. If you have an interested statistics department and people in other departments who are willing to at least be useful contact points and so on, the situation is very different.

A： 在我看来，做这件事并认真对待它的地方做得相当好。你看过《科学通才的教育》这篇论文吗这代表了一种乐观的观点，即为一些想成为科学通才的人提供多样化的教育可能会付出代价。那些没有听说过这篇论文的人应该知道，这四位作者分别是贝尔实验室的亨德里克·博德（Hendrik Bode）和莫斯特勒（Mosteller）和查理·温斯尔（Charlie Winsor），他与反馈技术有着密切的关系。我们没有太大的困难就达成一项提案。但我认为，这个问题的答案取决于你在一个学术组织中所能适应的方式。在数学系，在耶鲁、普林斯顿、哈佛、布朗等任何地方，这样做只能——我认为——被描述为完全不可行。如果你有一个感兴趣的统计部门和其他部门的人，他们至少愿意成为有用的联络点等等，情况就大不相同了。


If there was no reason for diversity the University of North Carolina would not require three statistics departments which is sort of historically what they had. I don't know the institution as an establishment at all, but I guess with much less than three you couldn't have covered the waterfront as well as you did - - you probably didn't cover it far enough anyway. It's the practicality of fitting into the establishment that controls that one, not otherwise.

如果没有多样性的理由，北卡罗来纳大学将不需要三个统计系，这在历史上是有点像的。我根本不知道这家机构是一家机构，但我想，如果你不到三家，你就不可能像你那样覆盖海滨——反正你可能覆盖得不够远。这是融入控制这一机构的实用性，而不是其他。


Q: How would you organise a statistics department?

Q： 你将如何组织一个统计部门？


A: Do the best you can fitting into the establishment. Probably straining the establishment a little, but not too much. A very delicate operation. As I understand things, Don Rubin at Harvard has actually made enough contact over enough time with the economists that really at that particular institution the economics - statistics gap is maybe almost gone. That's a thing that many other institutions - - I think - - would like to copy, if they knew how. 

A： 尽你所能融入公司。可能会给机构带来一点压力，但不会太大。非常精细的操作。据我所知，哈佛大学的唐·鲁宾在足够长的时间里与经济学家进行了充分的接触，在这一特定机构，经济统计数据的差距可能几乎消失了。这是许多其他机构——我想——如果他们知道怎么做的话——想要复制的东西。


## Qualifying Exam Questions

##  资格考试问题


Q: If $X$ is a Poisson random variable with expectation 2. What is its median?

Q： 如果$X$是期望值为2的泊松随机变量。它的中位数是多少？


A: I have difficulty inventing a third answer. There are at least two respectable answers. The strictly formal answer that says which jump in the cumulative includes $p=1 / 2$. That's formally correct, but not very helpful. Now, let's see. I have to do a small amount of mental calculation. If you like to use halves, the cumulative at $11 / 2$ is clearly less than $1 / 2$ and the cumulative at $21 / 2$ is bigger. And so, I would plot the cumulative at $11 / 2$ and the cumulative at $21 / 2$ and draw a straight line connecting those and say where that line cuts cumulative equal $1 / 2$ is a respectable definition of a median for this situation.

A： 我很难想出第三个答案。至少有两个值得尊敬的答案。严格意义上的正式答案是，累积的跳跃包括$p=1/2$。这在形式上是正确的，但不是很有用。现在，让我们看看。我必须做少量的心理计算。如果你喜欢使用一半，那么在$11/2$的累积值显然小于$1/2$，而在$21/2$的累计值更大。因此，我会绘制累积值为11/2美元和累积值为21/2美元的曲线，并绘制一条连接这些值的直线，并说明该直线在何处削减累积值等于1/2美元，这是对这种情况的中值的一个值得尊敬的定义。


Q: The answer is two. What's the answer when the expectation is ten?

Q： 答案是两个。当期望值为10时，答案是什么？


A: Well, one would have to compute, wouldn't one. Whichever definition we use, the question is: do I have to compute one value of the cumulative of the Poisson or two values of the cumulative of the Poisson? (You would have to compute two, yes.) To be sure, probably you compute two and if you compute two, then you can do the interpolation. So, the computational load for the two definitions is approximately the same.

A： 嗯，一个人必须计算，不是吗。无论我们使用哪种定义，问题是：我必须计算泊松累积的一个值还是泊松累积的两个值？（你必须计算两个，是的。）可以肯定的是，你可能会计算2，如果你计算2，那么你可以做插值。因此，两个定义的计算负载大致相同。


I am not that well acquainted with what it is you really want to look at here - - the percentage points of a Chi-squared and use Wilson-Hilferty? Can I have a show of hands of how many people know Wilson-Hilferty as such? Thirty percent.

我不太了解你真正想看的是什么——卡方的百分比，并使用威尔逊·希尔弗蒂？有多少人认识威尔逊·希尔弗蒂？百分之三十。


Q: You don't need to use Wilson-Hilferty.

Q： 你不需要使用威尔逊·希尔弗蒂。


A: You mean $\mu=0.667$ is close enough

A： 你的意思是$\mu=0.667$已经足够接近了


Q: No, the answer is ten.

Q： 不，答案是十。


A: You mean the first answer is ten. The second answer is probably 10 and a bit, but I don't know. Let me indoctrinate the audience on WilsonHilferty. Wilson-Hilferty says $-$ this is the other E.B. Wilson, Edwin Bidwell Wilson and a lady named Hilferty, about 1920 - - that to get a respectable percentage point of Chi-squared you take $\nu$ times the cube of the expression " $1-2 /(9 \nu)$ plus the corresponding normal deviate times the square root of $2 /(9 \nu)^{\prime \prime}$. This is remarkably good for $\nu$ from roughly say, 2 up. You don't need it for one, because you can get the percentage points for chi-squared on one out of the Gaussian table. But this is one that every statistician ought to have in their back pocket.

A： 你的意思是第一个答案是十。第二个答案可能是10，但我不知道。让我向观众灌输威尔森·希尔弗蒂的思想。威尔逊·希尔弗蒂说，这是另一位E.B.威尔逊、埃德温·比德维尔·威尔逊和一位名叫希尔弗蒂的女士，大约1920年——要得到一个可观的卡平方百分比，你需要$\nu$乘以表达式“$1-2/（9\nu）$的立方体加上相应的法向偏差乘以$2/（9\ nu）^的平方根$. 这对于$\nu$来说是非常好的，大约从2开始。你不需要它，因为你可以从高斯表中得到一个卡方的百分比。但这是每个统计学家都应该拥有的。


Q: When testing for significance for contrasts under conditions of multiplicity, we now can control the "false discovery proportion" instead of the family-wise error rate, thereby increasing power and rendering findings relatively invariant over changes in family size. With large families, the advantages are considerable. Two questions. How should we most constructively think about how to extend such advantages to the establishment of confidence intervals or what impediments stand in the way of such extensions?

Q： 当在多重性条件下测试对比度的显著性时，我们现在可以控制“错误发现比例”，而不是家族错误率，从而提高功率，并使发现在家族规模变化时相对不变。对于大家庭来说，优势是相当大的。两个问题。我们应该如何最有建设性地思考如何将这种优势扩展到建立信任区间，或者是什么阻碍了这种扩展？


A: How many people - - I am going to continue this polling process - how many people know about the Benjamini and Hochberg stuff? Running twenty percent maybe, o.k! Those who look at big multiple comparison situations, I think, predominantly feel that $5 \%$ simultaneous is being too stiff and that $5 \%$ individual is being too darn loose. Now, long ago I suggested using the average of the two guides as an intermediate significant difference, I never pushed it very much and I doubt if I could have sold it real well. Last year or two, Yoav Benjamini and Yosef Hochberg, both in Israel, have been working on the idea of controlling the fraction of the positive statements that you make that are wrong. Now, what this means, you see, is if you have things being compared and there are going to be very few significances, no matter how assessed, the FDR is going to be very much like the individual rate because you going to make maybe one positive statement on average. You are entitled to make, by this formal thing we have to correct in a moment, a twentieth of one. On the other hand, if you have a point, a point, a point and the standard error is about this much (using hand), there is only one difference left that you haven't cornered. Then this thing (the FDR) is going to tell you, you are going to behave very much like the individual thing, and that's fair enough, it's really simultaneous on one. It does seem to have good properties. Some of us, Lyle (Jones) included, believe that the first place you come to on this, is a matter of direction only, that is, the positive statements that you might make are that they differ in this direction or they differ in that direction. But the statement that they nearly differ is silly, because they all differ in some decimal place anyway. And if you talk about directions, then when you are getting very few definite ones, half of them have to be wrong because clearly these are things that have come about from small differences. That's oversimplified heuristics, but roughly right. So, you have to fix up the game somehow. The two Y's like to fix it up by saying that if you get zero over zero you count that as one full case of zero. I like to fix it up by saying if I'm doing things at 5 percent, I'm entitled to make two and a half percent as many false positives as one plus the number of positives. You have to seed things somehow at the beginning and there's a choice on how you do this. If Stephan will read the first part of this question again, I will tell you why I think it is not adequately formulated.

A： 有多少人——我将继续这个投票过程——有多少人知道本杰明尼和霍克伯格的事情？也许跑百分之二十，好吧！我认为，那些关注多重比较情况的人主要认为，$5\%$同时支付太过僵硬，$5\%$个人支付太过宽松。现在，很久以前我建议使用两个指南的平均值作为一个中间的显著差异，我从未大力推广，我怀疑我是否能够真正地销售它。去年或两年，以色列的约夫·本杰明尼（Yoav Benjamini）和约瑟夫·霍克伯格（Yoef Hochberg）一直致力于控制你所说的那些错误的积极言论。现在，这意味着，你看，如果你有一些东西被比较，并且没有什么意义，无论如何评估，FDR将非常类似于个人利率，因为你平均来说可能会做出一个积极的声明。你有权通过我们必须马上纠正的这件正式的事情，使之成为一的二十分之一。另一方面，如果你有一个点、一个点和一个点，并且标准误差大约是这么大（用手），那么你只剩下一个没有走投无路的差异。然后这件事（FDR）会告诉你，你会表现得非常像个人的事情，这是公平的，它真的是同时发生的。它看起来确实有很好的特性。我们中的一些人，包括莱尔（琼斯），认为你在这方面的第一步只是方向问题，也就是说，你可能会做出的积极声明是，他们在这个方向上不同，或者他们在那个方向上不同。但是，他们几乎不同的说法是愚蠢的，因为无论如何，他们都在小数点上有所不同。如果你谈论方向，那么当你得到很少明确的方向时，其中一半肯定是错误的，因为很明显，这些都是从微小的差异中产生的。这是过于简单的启发式，但大致正确。所以，你必须设法解决这个问题。两个Y就像是通过说，如果你得到的是零超过零，你就把它算作一个完整的零。我喜欢通过这样的方式来解决这个问题：如果我以5%的速度做事，我有权做出一个加上阳性数的2.5%的假阳性。你必须在一开始就以某种方式播种，你可以选择如何这样做。如果Stephan将再次阅读这个问题的第一部分，我将告诉你为什么我认为它没有充分表述。

Q: How should we most constructively think about how to extend such advantages to the establishment of confidence intervals?
 
Q： 我们应该如何最有建设性地思考如何将这些优势扩展到建立置信区间？


A: The point is that confidence intervals are not confined - the positive confidence intervals are not that different from negative confidence intervals. And, my guess is - - and I haven't thought this through long enough - - but my guess is you end up using simultaneous things for the confidence intervals anyway. I doubt that a very hybridaceous thing that says, well we aren't going to make a positive confidence interval statement erroneously more than two and a half percent of the time we make positive confidence interval statements and negative confidence interval statements we don't want to be wrong more than two and a half experiments out of a hundred. That sort of hybrid thing that says: "once the statement ceases to be positive, you change the bases on which you evaluate suddenly". - I don't see how to make that one fly any more. I think I have a suspicion it's never going to fly. So, I don't see anything wrong in principle with using the false discovery proportion for directionality and the simultaneous calculation for the confidence intervals. The fact that I will get some upward directional statements where the confidence interval includes values less than zero doesn't bother me very much. I don't have to have a seamless connection between the two. I offered an extension that is viable and the impediment that stands in its way is it's not as logically seamless as you might like. But I think it's better than any seamless one I see. Directional statements versus "I'm uncertain about direction" is a very great difference. A confidence interval that just doesn't quite cover zero and one that just does cover zero are very much nearly the same thing. They ought not to be connected in a seamless way.

A： 关键是置信区间不受限制——正置信区间与负置信区间没有太大区别。而且，我的猜测是——我还没想够长时间——但我猜你最终还是会在置信区间使用同时的东西。我怀疑一个非常杂交的东西，我们不会错误地做出正置信区间陈述超过百分之二点五，在我们做出正置信间隔陈述和负置信区间陈述的时候，我们不希望错误超过百分之一点五的实验。这种混杂的说法是：“一旦声明不再是积极的，你就会突然改变评估的基础”。-我不知道怎么让那只苍蝇飞了。我想我怀疑它永远不会飞。因此，我认为在原则上，使用错误发现比例计算方向性和同时计算置信区间没有任何错误。事实上，我会得到一些向上的陈述，其中置信区间包括小于零的值，这并不会让我很困扰。我不必在两者之间建立无缝连接。我提供了一个可行的扩展，而阻碍它的障碍是，它不像你想的那样逻辑上无缝。但我认为这比我看到的任何无缝的都要好。方向性陈述与“我不确定方向”有很大区别。一个不完全覆盖零的置信区间和一个覆盖零的可信区间几乎是一样的。它们不应该以无缝的方式连接。


## Arguing the Fiducial Argument with R. A. Fisher

##  与R·A·费希尔讨论信义论证


Q: In the correspondence that you had with R.A. Fisher about the fiducial argument it ends very suddenly. You offered some counter-examples and he said you were foolish. Then you offered a different counter-example and he said something else that was sort of rude and then you said you were going to England to visit him and that was the last was in that correspondence. $I$ was wondering if you could finish the story.

Q： 在你和R.A.费希尔关于信托论点的信件中，它突然结束了。你举了一些反例，他说你很愚蠢。然后你举了一个不同的反例，他说了一些有点粗鲁的话，然后你说你要去英国看望他，这是最后一封信$我想知道你能否完成这个故事。


A: Well, I was talking with Sir Ronald in his office. And I think roughly what I said was that I didn't see the logical strength of the fiducial argument but I gave a lot of weight to the fact that he thought it was a good idea. At which point he did his best to show me the door. Since Elizabeth was out in the garden in the other direction, talking to one of the daughters, I didn't get shown the door. So he grabbed his hat and his cane and went toodling out the door himself. I would say that was the end of the correspondence. Q: So, we never got to the bottom of the fiducial argument then?

A： 嗯，我在罗纳德爵士的办公室里和他交谈。我大致认为我所说的是，我没有看到基准论点的逻辑力量，但我对他认为这是一个好主意这一事实给予了很大的重视。这时，他尽力给我开门。因为伊丽莎白在另一个方向的花园里，和其中一个女儿说话，所以我没有被带出门。于是他抓起帽子和手杖，自己走出了门。我可以说，这是信件的结尾。


A: No, we got to a place where it was - - I think - - mutually felt that further debate between these two parties would not get us any deeper. Now, whether we got to the bottom at that point or two different bottoms or what-not I leave that for other people to judge.

Q： 那么，我们就再也没有找到基准论点的底部了？

A： 不，我们到了一个地方——我想——双方都觉得，这两个政党之间的进一步辩论不会让我们更深入。现在，无论我们是在那一点触底，还是两个不同的触底，我都会让其他人来判断。


## Statistics 411

##  统计411


Q: We heard a lot in this session and yesterday about a course Stats 411 for undergraduates. Can you explain what this course was, what sort of topics were involved and what happened to the notes?

Q： 我们在这节课和昨天听到了很多关于为本科生开设的Stats 411课程的消息。你能解释一下这门课是什么，涉及的主题是什么，笔记是怎么回事吗？


A: Well, I'll answer in reverse order in part. The notes take up about a filing case upstairs. That's what happened to the notes. I wouldn't be surprised if you could get a better answer from some of the people who took the course than you can from me. As to what was in it and so on. Who wants to volunteer?

A： 好吧，我会按照相反的顺序回答部分问题。这些笔记涉及楼上的一个档案案。笔记就是这样的。如果你能从一些参加课程的人那里得到比我更好的答案，我不会感到惊讶。至于里面有什么等等。谁想做志愿者？


Q: I've got part of an answer. I taught 411 two years ago and prior to doing that I was suitably humbled, I asked John if I could borrow a copy of the notes and he did. He sent me - - not all of it - - but a subset which I'll be happy to share if its all right with John - - and I read them and they're fascinating. But there wasn't a chance in the world that the students that I knew would be able to understand it - - at least with me as a teacher. So, we did other topics. This was a course for seniors in engineering. And it tends to be the last course they take.

Q： 我得到了部分答案。两年前我教过411门课，在教之前，我非常谦卑地问约翰，我能不能借一本笔记，他照做了。他寄给我——不是全部——而是一个子集，如果可以的话，我很乐意与约翰分享——我读了它们，它们很吸引人。但我认识的学生根本没有机会理解它——至少在我作为一名老师的情况下。所以，我们做了其他话题。这是一门面向工程专业大四学生的课程。这往往是他们最后的课程。


A: This is not an adequate description of the situation when the course was being given by me. This was a course - - as somebody had said around here - - for seniors majoring in the department, graduate students, etc., etc. and strays from all sorts of places. Henry Braun said he took the course for six years in a row while he was a faculty member. The one thing that I always used to do was to get the seniors to sit up front at the table and make it clear I was going to answer their questions before I answered anybody else's. Otherwise I think the moral pressures on the students would have been bad. What it was, was an attempt to start at the beginning and be serious about it. Not serious mathematically, but serious statistically. That might mean a couple of weeks talking about one-sample questions, taking the view that the standard assumptions are almost guaranteed never to be the truth. So, you want to understand, what happens when they're not true. Does this accord with your readings, Howard?

A： 这不是对我开设课程时情况的充分描述。这是一门课程——正如有人在这里所说的那样——面向该系的大四学生、研究生等，以及来自不同地方的学生。亨利·布劳恩（Henry Braun）表示，他在担任教员期间连续六年参加了这门课程。我过去经常做的一件事就是让老年人坐在桌子前面，明确表示我会在回答其他人的问题之前回答他们的问题。否则我认为学生们的道德压力会很糟糕。这是一种从一开始就认真对待的尝试。数学上不严肃，但统计上严肃。这可能意味着几周时间讨论一个样本问题，认为标准假设几乎可以保证永远不会是事实。所以，你想知道，当他们不真实时会发生什么。这和你的阅读一致吗，霍华德？


Audience: I think, I tried to do that. 

观众：我想，我试过这样做。

A: I think Stephan certainly sat through this course at least once.

A： 我想斯蒂芬肯定至少参加了一次这门课。


Audience: Twice, I think. The course was like this. John came in with a Ziploc, the lectures were nicely parcelled out, the course was in topics, numbered, and the numbering varied from year to year. So there were several numbers for each topic. A topic could be $14 \mathrm{~N}$ but at the same time also topic 9 for the course given in 1979. Clearly the course content evolved quite a bit during the years. It was well-structured. It started out with single sample - - single batch - - questions. How do you estimate location? How do you estimate scale? What do you do, if you have several of them? It went on I think - - in the years I took it - $-$ up to ANOVA.


观众：我想是两次。课程是这样的。约翰带着Ziploc走进来，讲座布置得很好，课程分主题，编号，每年的编号都不一样。所以每个主题都有几个数字。一个主题可以是$14\mathrm｛~N｝$，但同时也是1979年课程的主题9。很明显，这些年来课程内容发生了很大变化。它结构良好。它从一个样本——一个批次——问题开始。您如何估计位置？你如何估计规模？如果你有几个，你会怎么做？我想，在过去的几年里，我一直在进行方差分析。


Audience: It included $(\psi, w)$-technology, $(g, h)$-technology, orstats, gaps, simultaneous confidence, lots of things.

观众：它包括$（\psi，w）$-技术，$（g，h）$-科技，或统计，差距，同时的信心，很多东西。


## The Future of Data Analysis Including Statistics

##  包括统计在内的数据分析的未来


Q: What do you see as the future of industrial statisticians?

Q： 你认为工业统计学家的未来是什么？


A: I never was on the industrial firing line, in any real sense anyway. The more difficult question - - I think $--$ is how much better will people making greater use of statisticians fare in the industrial competition than those who make lesser use of statisticians? Again, this is an establishment question. Some years ago, there was a period of half a dozen years when IBM didn't talk to BTL because the lawyers were feuding over the patent agreement. And after that relaxed, there was a delegation of brass from the IBM research laboratory who came to Murray Hill, and a detachment (from BTL) that went up there. I think the two largest surprises - because you see, at this point you had people in the range of administrative levels that would get involved, who wouldn't have been involved seven or eight years ago and they really didn't know anything in detail about the other organizations. The thing that struck them the most, I think, was how many statisticians there were at Murray Hill and how few there were up in suburban New York. And this was at a time when some people would have said these were the two best industrial laboratories, or maybe, two of some very small number of the best. So, even in research, things were not uniform - - now, I don't think that IBM's difficulties came about from not having more statisticians - - it would be nice to think that, but there were other reasons. They were generally a stick-in-the-mud outfit as far as their computers went. And they were shocked when they first realised they were spending more money on software development than on hardware development. If industrial statisticians are going to flourish, they are going to have to do different things than they used to. Industrial arithmeticians are not going to get hired as such. Arithmetic is a well-stabilized field and to the extent that it's needed, people pick it up. But, statistics and data analysis isn't at the moment a well-stabilized field, and hasn't been, and there can be a particular need for having people who are reasonably upto-date and are growing forward and in various directions. Whether this means TQM or not, I don't know. George isn't here, we cannot put the bite on him and see what he had to say. I think, there's a strong future if they adapt well enough to the changing needs - - and I just wonder as a whole, how many of them have been changing at all. The industrial statisticians, in double red quotes, that we had here these two days include Colin who is talking about the kind of experimental design that would drive a classical experimental designer up the wall and John Chambers who was talking about the origins of $S$ and where it might go and whether it might accommodate EDA. Times are changing and if the industrial statisticians don't change, other people will do the change - - maybe called something else. Remember the early days of cathode ray tubes - TV display tubes - - the net result of the situation was to invent a new profession, called shrinkage analysts. Because at that time about three percent of the things that started out to be TV display tubes came out at the other end of the process as satisfactory finished ones. So, what you had to analyse was how things shrank as you went along. Now, the fact that they got to be shrinkage analysts says that the industrial statisticians either weren't there or that the industrial statisticians at the time didn't see the need to think differently.


A： 无论如何，从任何实际意义上来说，我从未站在工业火线上。更困难的问题是——我认为美元——美元是，在工业竞争中，更多地使用统计学家的人会比较少使用统计学家更好吗？同样，这是一个体制问题。几年前，有五六年的时间，IBM没有与BTL交谈，因为律师们在专利协议上争执不下。放松之后，有一个来自IBM研究实验室的高级官员代表团来到了Murray Hill，还有一个分队（来自BTL）前往那里。我认为最大的两个惊喜是，因为你知道，在这一点上，你会有一系列行政级别的人参与进来，他们在七年或八年前不会参与进来，而且他们真的对其他组织一无所知。我认为，最令他们震惊的是，默里山有多少统计学家，而纽约郊区的统计学家却很少。当时，有些人会说这是两个最好的工业实验室，或者说是少数几个最好的实验室中的两个。所以，即使在研究中，情况也不尽相同——现在，我不认为IBM的困难来自于没有更多的统计学家——这样想会很好，但还有其他原因。就他们的电脑而言，他们通常是一个穿着泥衣服的人。当他们第一次意识到他们在软件开发上的花费比在硬件开发上的更多时，他们感到震惊。如果工业统计学家要蓬勃发展，他们将不得不做与过去不同的事情。工业算术家不会被这样雇佣。算术是一个非常稳定的领域，在需要的程度上，人们会选择它。但是，统计和数据分析目前还不是一个稳定的领域，而且还没有稳定下来，而且可能特别需要有一个合理的最新的、正在朝着不同方向发展的人。这是否意味着全面质量管理，我不知道。乔治不在，我们不能咬他一口，看看他说了什么。我认为，如果他们能够很好地适应不断变化的需求，未来会很美好。我只是想知道，作为一个整体，他们中有多少人一直在改变。这两天我们在这里看到的工业统计学家，用双红引号，包括科林，他在谈论一种实验设计，这种设计会把一个经典的实验设计师推到墙上，还有约翰·钱伯斯，他在讨论新元的起源，它可能会去哪里，以及它是否适合EDA。时代在变，如果工业统计学家不改变，其他人也会改变——也许叫其他人。还记得阴极射线管（电视显示管）的早期吗？这种情况的最终结果是发明了一种新的职业，叫做收缩分析。因为当时，大约百分之三的电视显示管在制作过程的另一端被制作成了令人满意的成品。所以，你需要分析的是，随着你的发展，事情是如何缩小的。现在，他们成为收缩分析师的事实表明，工业统计学家要么不在那里，要么当时的工业统计学家认为没有必要另辟蹊径。

I see Stu in the background there. And about the only thing we are willing to fight about publicly is Taguchi, I think. I regard much of what Taguchi said as overexpressed, unwarranted language. But it is not clear to me that in the early stages of fixing processes you need the degree of security that comes with classical experimental design. And that if you operate à la Taguchi you may get most of the gold at the grass roots and after that, if you don't go and do something better, it's just too darn bad. But that doesn't leave me feeling bad. Now, I don't have to deal with these people who learn Taguchi as a watch word and don't know anything about him. Those who do, have my deep sympathy.

我在后台看到斯图。我认为，我们唯一愿意公开争论的是田口。我认为田口所说的很多话都是过度表达、毫无根据的语言。但我并不清楚，在修复过程的早期阶段，你需要经典实验设计带来的安全程度。如果你像田口一样经营，你可能会在基层获得大部分的黄金，而在那之后，如果你不去做一些更好的事情，那就太糟糕了。但这并没有让我感到难过。现在，我不必和那些把田口当作一个观察词而对他一无所知的人打交道。对此，我深表同情。


Q: I tell people, John, that they should listen to what the gentleman has to say philosophically and avoid his technology.

Q： 我告诉人们，约翰，他们应该从哲学上听这位绅士的话，避免使用他的技术。


A: What I'm saying is maybe the opposite. Don't believe what he says about the security of his results but in early days the technology may be a good one. Maybe - - I don't know. I have not been on the firing line in this direction. 

A： 我所说的可能恰恰相反。不要相信他所说的结果的安全性，但在早期，这项技术可能是一项很好的技术。也许——我不知道。我没有在这个方向上处于火线上。

Q: It's like pulling weeds.

Q： 这就像拔草一样。


A: Well, I pull weeds.

A： 嗯，我拔杂草。


Q: My question relates to a question I asked you in 1961.

Q： 我的问题与1961年我问你的一个问题有关。


A: Well, I hope I won't give the same answer.

A： 我希望我不会给出同样的答案。


Q: The question at that time was - - I was starting out in statistics - I asked you what I should read. You told me, the early Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Supplement and Discussion. I found this a very important learning experience and have also been using it in teaching. I was wondering if a young person came to you today, what would you tell him to start reading?

Q： 当时的问题是——我刚开始学统计学——我问你我应该读什么。你告诉我的，《皇家统计学会早期期刊》，增刊和讨论。我发现这是一次非常重要的学习经历，并一直在教学中使用。我想知道如果今天有一个年轻人来找你，你会告诉他什么让他开始阅读？


A: I guess you have to start at the same place, because to start anywhere else, you assume that they are a lot further along than you are when you start. And that one refers also to some of this thing about consulting, because the nearest thing to a surrogate for consulting that $I$ know is to go and read the supplement to JRSS. This is something that only requires a library and it's not going to penetrate nearly as much as experience would, but it's going to penetrate in some of the same directions. There was a reasonably savvy group of people who were in the Industrial Application section of the RSS in those days and the agricultural departments, and a lot of this does come through, as you and I both know.

A： 我想你必须从同一个地方开始，因为要从其他地方开始，你会认为他们比你开始时走得更远。这一条还提到了一些关于咨询的事情，因为$I$知道的最接近代理咨询的事情是去阅读JRSS的补充。这是一个只需要一个图书馆的东西，它不会像经验那样深入，但它会朝着相同的方向渗透。当时有一群相当精明的人在RSS的工业应用部门和农业部门工作，正如你和我都知道的那样，很多人都做到了。


Q: How many Ph.D.. students did you have over the years?

Q： 多少博士。。这些年来你有学生吗？


A: Stephan you have been looking at lists, maybe you know?

A： 斯蒂芬，你一直在看名单，也许你知道吗？


Audience: I don't know.

观众：我不知道。


Audience: Eileen said last night, that you had over forty.

观众：艾琳昨晚说，你已经超过40岁了。


Q: What have been some of your greatest satisfactions and regrets over the years?

Q： 这些年来，你最大的满意和遗憾是什么？


A: I've avoided the classification.

A： 我避免了分类。


Q: What do you see as the future of statistics in Princeton?

Q： 你认为普林斯顿统计的未来是什么？


A: (Laughter) I have various sized crystal balls, but none of them big enough for this. We're in a time of academic retrenchment. We're presumably going to lose some good statistical departments in some places. If there were sufficient numbers of analogs of me, so that teaching things could be tried out and enough books written, then... There's a basic difficulty which Dick Link would present as saying that a good statistician must be a schizophrenic, because he has to deal with uncertainty and the measurement of uncertainty - - that's his main task - - and to do this using the most certain tool we have which is mathematics. He has to bridge across the gap here. I don't see any reason to believe that statistics in a mathematics department is going to be other than a hard and dangerous life. On the other hand, statistics as a separate entity is going to have a different set of reasons for being a hard and dangerous life. Paul Velleman was arguing about statistics being a science. I would tend to think it would have been more accurate to say science-and-technology. We face the facts, but the academic technologists have by and large ceased to teach engineering. And the way academic society is organized it's not clear how a pure technology acquires intellectual stature, except through individuals. But for my money, statistics, along the lines of the Mosteller \& Tukey review in the psychology handbook, data analysis - - statistics, is a pure technology. In physics, theoretical physics draws the attention of most of the undergraduate students or most of the graduate students. Now, that's maybe a good thing in a backhanded sort of way. Somebody was telling me yesterday that they're making 1400 physics Ph.D.'s a year in this country and there aren't going to be that many who do theoretical physics. On the other hand, theoretical physicists, it's been well established, can be converted to almost anything. Experimentalists probably can't. So maybe it's good that theoretical physics attracts the crowd. The point is though that physics has had an old well-established intellectual reputation. And I don't think we'd get away with training 1400 Ph.D.'s a year in statistics and have most of them leave and go into all sorts of other things. I don't think that would be as acceptable as it is for theoretical physicists. There are some internal contradictions at very high levels. If you wanted to ask me where I think I failed the profession most, it would be in the direction of (not) doing something about this.

A： （笑声）我有各种大小的水晶球，但没有一个足够大。我们正处于学术紧缩的时期。我们可能会在一些地方失去一些好的统计部门。如果有足够数量的类似我的人，这样可以尝试教学，写出足够的书，那么。。。迪克·林克（Dick Link）会说，一个好的统计学家必须是一个精神分裂症患者，这是一个基本的困难，因为他必须处理不确定性和不确定性的测量——这是他的主要任务——并且要用我们所拥有的最确定的工具——数学——来做到这一点。他必须跨过这条鸿沟。我看不出有任何理由相信数学系的统计数据将是艰难而危险的生活。另一方面，统计数据作为一个独立的实体，将有一套不同的理由来解释生活的艰难和危险。保罗·韦勒曼（Paul Velleman）认为统计学是一门科学。我倾向于认为说科学和技术更准确。我们面对事实，但学术技术专家基本上已经停止教授工程学。学术社会的组织方式也不清楚纯技术是如何获得智力地位的，除非是通过个人。但对我来说，根据Mosteller和Tukey在心理学手册中的评论，数据分析——统计——是一种纯粹的技术。在物理学中，理论物理学吸引了大多数本科生或大多数研究生的注意。从反手的角度来说，这也许是件好事。昨天有人告诉我，在这个国家，他们一年要获得1400个物理学博士学位，而做理论物理学的人不会那么多。另一方面，理论物理学家，它已经得到了很好的证实，可以转化为几乎任何东西。实验学家可能做不到。所以，理论物理学吸引大众也许是好事。重点是，物理学有着悠久的学术声誉。我不认为我们会逃避每年1400名统计学博士的培训，让他们中的大多数人离开，从事各种其他工作。我认为这对理论物理学家来说是不可接受的。在很高的层次上存在一些内部矛盾。如果你想问我，我认为我最失败的职业是哪里，那就应该（不）做些什么。
